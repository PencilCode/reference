## The Code

<pre class="examp">
ht()
randpos = ->
  [200 * random([-200..200]), 200 * random([-200..200])]
remakea = ->
  col = random color
  a.wear col
  a.pen col
  a.turnto randpos()
remakeb = ->
  col = random color
  b.wear col
  b.pen col
  b.turnto randpos()
remakec = ->
  col = random color
  c.wear col
  c.pen col
  c.turnto randpos()
a = new Turtle
remakea()
b = new Turtle
remakeb()
c = new Turtle
remakec()
while true
  a.fd 200
  remakea()
  b.fd 200
  remakeb()
  c.fd 200
  remakec()
  if not a.touches window

  await done defer()
</pre>

### Parts

#### Functions

There are four functions at work in this code: `randpos()`, `remakea()`, `remakeb()` and `remakec()`. 

The last three are exactly the same except they each affect a different object. 

##### `randpos()`

```coffeescript
randpos = ->
  [200 * random([-200..200]), 200 * random([-200..200])]
```

Generates a random set of coordinates in a 200 by 200 box, centered on the origin. 

##### `remakea()`

```coffeescript
remakea = ->
  col = random color
  a.wear col
  a.pen col
  a.turnto randpos()
```

This function changes the color and pen color of the `a` turtle and turns it to face a location generated by `randpos()`. 

This is the same for the `remakeb()` and `remakec()` functions, but affecting the `b` and `c` turtles respectively. 

#### Loop

```coffeescript
while true
  a.fd 200
  remakea()
  b.fd 200
  remakeb()
  c.fd 200
  remakec()
  await done defer()
```

This `while` loop creates all the motion in the code: moving the turtles, changing their colors and changing their destinations. Because of `await done defer()`, the loop runs every time the turtles finish moving. Because the conditional input is `true`, the loop will continue running until the code is stopped.
