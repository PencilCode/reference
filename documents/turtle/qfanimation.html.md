## Why Mix Queue- and Frame-Based Animation?

[Queue-based animation](qanimation.html) and [frame-based animation](fanimation.html) may seem like completely different types of programming, but they are both based off the same concept. The only difference is that, in queue-based animation, you're seeing the results long after the code is completed, but in frame-based animation, the program is broken into a series of frames which are displayed immediately and instantaniously upon completion. 

While it is sometimes difficult to do, mixing the two types of animation can allow you to create very complex code that would otherwise be impossible.
