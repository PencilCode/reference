An angle can be used to determine how far an object rotates when using certain commands. One example of such a command is [lt](lt.html). 

<pre class="jumbo">
lt <span data-dfn="angle">90</span>
</pre>

Angles can also be used to determine the direction of one object from another, such as in the [direction](direction.html) command. 

<pre class="jumbo">
p.turnto <span data-dfn="returns an angle">direction(turtle)</span>
</pre>
