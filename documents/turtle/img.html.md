Pencil Code allows images to be used very easily. Images can be worn by objects using [`wear`](wear.html), or they can just be displayed using `img`. 

### Syntax

<pre class="jumbo">
a = img '<span data-dfn="name or url">tree</span>'
</pre>

* The name can be anything, and if it is found on the [Wikimedia Commons](), then it is displayed. Otherwise, the result is the Pencil Code pencil.
