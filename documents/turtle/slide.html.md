`slide` is essentially the same as [`movexy`](movexy.html), and replaces the old [`move`](move.html) command. 

The error <code class="error">"move" has been depricated, use "slide"</code> means that the old `move` command was used somewhere in your code. To fix this, just replace `move` with `slide`. It will function the same way without needing any additional changes.
